* Intro
** My name is JD
** Modern Message

* How I got Started
** Developing Alexa skills for Bloc

* Game of Trivia

* It's _really_ easy like _really_ _really_ easy

* I think the language that's most supported (due to documentation) has been javascript. 
** But who likes javascript??

* There are three different parts to developing an alexa skill
** Code -> It's just a series of json payloads going back and forth
** Intents -> The functions that your skill will perform
** Slots -> User input data that maps to the intents for a function

* Code 
** Server (Sinatra or Rails)
** Preferrably need a library to handle the loads
** The right Alexa requirements

* Intents
** The fucntions that your skill can do
*** Fires when utterences are made -> Things a customer will say to your app
* Slots
** Information provided by user to complete an intent

* Lets see some code
** What you need
** Predefined Intents
